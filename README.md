proj_euler
==========
This is where I post all of the Project Euler solution programs I've written in Python.
So far I have solutions (in Python) to problems:
8 Largest Product in a Series
9 Special Pythagorean Triplet
14 Longest Collatz Sequence
16 Power Digit Sum

Some are user friendly, allowing for a one off prompt to solve the problem or any general case of it.
Those which aren't are easily convertible but I haven't gotten around to adding it in yet (if you know Python,
I'm sure you can insert a raw_input or two to help yourself).
